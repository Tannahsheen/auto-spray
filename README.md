navigate to where you would like to use the tool from and git clone this repo. 
``` #!/bin/bash
cd auto-spray
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

I suggest using a venv when you run this program.

Here is an exmaple of the syntax in use. 


``` #!/bin/bash

auto-spray8.py -d <target domain> -e <user email> -k <APIKEY> -v -ipfile <your-scope.txt>)
